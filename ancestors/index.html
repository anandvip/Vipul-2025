  </div>

  <p>To those who walked before me—<br>
  whose hands tilled the land,<br>
  whose silence held grief I could never name,<br>
  whose sacrifices wove the ground beneath my feet—<br>
  I speak now.</p>

  <div class="verse">
    I have carried your hopes,<br>
    sometimes not knowing they weren’t mine.<br>
    I have walked in your name,<br>
    even when the path wounded my soul.
  </div>

  <p>I am not turning my back on you. I am turning my face toward <strong>truth</strong>.</p>

  <div class="verse">
    This phase of life calls me to <strong>release</strong>—<br>
    not to forget you,<br>
    but to walk forward <em>with lighter steps</em>.
  </div>

  <p>The land has spoken to me. And I have listened. But now I must listen to the voice within me too—
  the one you passed down through blood and breath.</p>

  <div class="verse">
    If I let go,<br>
    know that it is not rejection.<br>
    It is return.<br>
    To myself.<br>
    To freedom.<br>
    To the one you dreamed of, but may not have had the chance to become.
  </div>

  <p>May you walk with me—not as weight, but as <strong>wind</strong>. Not as boundary, but as <strong>blessing</strong>.</p>

  <p>Thank you.<br>
  I go now, in peace.</p>

  <p style="text-align:right; margin-top: 3rem;">—Vipul</p>
